# Jake-Hoback-MK-Ultra
The Jake Hoback MK Ultra UHEP is a small flipper folder with a 2.5" tanto tip blade! The AEB-L stainless steel is super purified. The mil-spec hard anodized aluminum handle is very lightweight and has notches at the rear of the handle for a reverse grip. There are thumb notches on the spine of the blade as well.
